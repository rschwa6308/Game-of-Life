# Game-of-Life
John Conway's Game of Life made using Pygame


The Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway.   

## Rules
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
